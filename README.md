About the data
The data is about the elements of the soil to predict the target variable "soc_stock_t_ha"
The dataset - 5091 rows, 306 columns

Being very sparsely spread data points with high correlation between the features, I have tried to apply Linear Regression Polynomial Regression and Decision Regressor and could get fair results.
To further enhance and optimize I have also tried PCA, Ridge and LASSO.

Your suggestions are welcome!
